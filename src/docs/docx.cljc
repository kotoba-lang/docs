  "A document as a .docx, and back.

  ## Where this lives

  The same arrangement as `slides.pptx` and `sheets.xlsx`: `ooxml` supplies
  the OPC vocabulary — content types, relationships, the package — and knows
  nothing about documents. It already anticipated this one, returning
  `:docx` for a `word/` prefix. A `wordprocessingml` repository to hold what
  turned out to be one namespace would have been a repository for the
  symmetry of it.

  ## Structure rather than appearance

  A heading is written as a paragraph carrying `w:pStyle Heading1`, not as
  bold 18pt text. Word renders both the same way and only one of them can be
  read back as a heading, collapsed into an outline, or restyled by whoever
  receives it. The same choice runs through: a list is `w:numPr` and not a
  line beginning with `-`, a table is `w:tbl` and not aligned spaces.

  That means writing `styles.xml` and `numbering.xml`, which a document with
  no styles does not need and a document anyone opens does. Both are small
  and both are here.

  ## What a round trip keeps

  Block kind, order, text, heading level, list ordering, and table cells.
  What it does not keep is block ids — .docx has nowhere to put them, the
  same as Markdown — so `read` regenerates them and the tests say so rather
  than comparing whole documents.

  Comments and suggestions are not written. Word has both, and they are not
  the same objects: a `docs` comment anchors to a block id, which is exactly
  what does not survive the trip.

  ## Reading meets more than writing produces

  A .docx from Word has `w:rPr` runs, `w:proofErr` markers, bookmarks,
  section properties, and paragraphs split into a dozen runs by nothing more
  than a spell-checker. The reader concatenates every `w:t` under a
  paragraph for that reason: taking the first would truncate most real
  documents to their first few characters."
