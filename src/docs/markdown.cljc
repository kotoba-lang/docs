  "A document as Markdown, and back.

  ## Why this exists

  A document could only leave as EDN, which is the same as not leaving: the
  format is exact and nothing else reads it. Markdown is what a person can
  open, paste into a mail, or put under version control, and the block model
  here maps onto it almost exactly — a heading is a heading, a list is a
  list, a table is a table.

  ## Almost

  Three things do not survive, and the point of `unexpressed` is that a
  document can be asked what it will lose *before* someone exports it rather
  than after.

  **Block ids are not written and are regenerated on the way back.** There is
  nowhere in Markdown to put them, and the usual trick — an HTML comment
  carrying the id — produces a file that only this application can read back
  faithfully while looking like an ordinary one. Ids here are handles
  (`block-by-id`, a comment's anchor), not content. Round-tripping a document
  through Markdown therefore gives an equal document with different ids, and
  the tests say so rather than comparing whole documents and quietly passing
  because the fixture happened to use `b1`, `b2`.

  **Comments and suggestions are not written.** They are not text in the
  document; they are things said about it.

  **A style Markdown has no syntax for is not written.** `**` and `*` and
  backticks cover bold, italic and code. A run carrying a colour, a font, a
  highlight has no spelling here, so `unexpressed` names it and the text goes
  out unstyled — visibly plain rather than plausibly wrong.

  ## What reading accepts

  More than writing produces, because whatever is pasted in was not written
  by this namespace: ATX headings, `>` quotes, fenced code, `-`/`*`/`+` and
  `1.` lists, GFM pipe tables, and blank-line-separated paragraphs. It never
  throws — malformed input becomes the nearest block, usually a paragraph,
  and the validator is what reports a document it cannot accept. A parser
  that threw would turn a bad paste into a 500."
